# <u>Connecting Two switches and Two PC's</u>

The first course of action is to use a straight through cable for a connection to be established between PC1 and SW1. This is then followed by a connection with a cross-over cable between SW1 and SW2.

Furthermore, we finally connect SW2 to PC2 by using a straight through cable.

The Switches used within this lab 3650-24PS and we utilized command config within the CLI to change the name of the switches using the command hostname.

We also require an IP address to configure the switch and to go into the switch, we configured Vlan1 interface by using the command int Vlan1 and assigned an IP address for switch 1 first.

Prior to configuring an IP address to Vlan 1 we changed the state to up, by using the command no shut.

We also did the same for SW2.

The next step was to also action and configure the IP addresses for both PC's, we first go to the fast Ethernet section apply the Ip address and then test the ping within the command prompt section.

The next Lab I will be introducing router to the topology, and try to expand the network more with my current knowledge.

The best method to learn is through practice :) 

## <u>Key Concepts</U>

1. Networks/commands don't action what you want them to do but what you tell them to do so be cautious with your inputs.
2. For sanity reasons always check once the IP address have been configured that the connectivity can be established or whether it is up and running by pinging the Switches or PC's.
3. Understand which commands lines should be used depending on the user mode.
